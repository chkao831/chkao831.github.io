Global mean sea-level is rising at a rate of 3.2 mm/year and this rate is increasing, with the latest studies suggesting possible increase in sea-level of 0.3-2.5 m by 2100, due to melting of the polar ice sheets (Greenland, Antarctica). With this in mind, Sandia National Laboratories have been developing the MPAS-Albany Land Ice (MALI) Model, as part of the DOE’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model, to provide actionable projections of 21st century sea-level rise and support national security missions on high performance computing (HPC) systems.

Our team focused on building a framework for each type of data to facilitate the automated parameter tuning for ice sheet simulations of Earth’s polar ice sheets. This is part of an ongoing effort to modernize climate software and develop more accurate and reliable models for probabilistic sea-level projections. We explored a subset of the input parameter space to tune performance, utilized grid and random search for optimization, and automated the tuning process with an efficient framework.
